# Session & Lifecycle Integration Map

## 1. Component Overview

| Component | Lifecycle Scope | Persisted? | Key State | Clears on Dismiss? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| BrowserEngine | Activity | No (in-memory) | URL, scroll position, DOM | N/A (independent) |
| AiChatViewModel | Activity (ViewModel) | Partial | conversationId, messages, sourceUrl | No — persists across show/hide |
| ChatHistory | Disk (JSON files) | Yes | conversation files with sourceUrl | N/A (persistent store) |
| ModalBottomSheet | Composition | No | showAiChat, showSessionChoice | Yes — all state reset |
| SessionLog | Process + Disk | Yes | Event log (JSONL) | N/A (append-only) |

**Key insight**: ViewModel state (conversationId, messages) persists across bottom sheet show/hide cycles.
Composition state (showAiChat, forceNewSession, etc.) resets on dismiss.
This asymmetry is the root of several bugs.

## 2. Key State Variables

### MainActivity (composition state — resets on sheet dismiss)

```
showAiChat: Boolean         — whether chat bottom sheet is visible
showSessionChoice: Boolean  — whether session resume dialog is showing
matchedConversationId: String?  — ID of URL-matched conversation (for dialog)
currentUrlForChat: String?  — URL at time of chat button click
forceNewSession: Boolean    — skip URL matching, start fresh
pendingAiQuestion: String?  — pre-filled question from onAskAi
```

#### State Reset on Dismiss (TWO paths, DIFFERENT behavior)

| Path | showAiChat | pendingAiQuestion | matchedConversationId | forceNewSession |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **onDismissRequest** (swipe/back) | false | null | null | **false** (reset) |
| **onDismiss** (X button inside AiChatScreen) | false | null | null | **false** (reset) |

**Both paths now reset all composition state consistently.** Previously, swipe dismiss did not reset
`forceNewSession`, causing URL matching to be skipped on next open. Fixed in commit 959d157.

**Note**: `currentUrlForChat` is NOT reset by either dismiss path. This is acceptable because it's
re-set on every chat button click. However, stale URL state persists if the sheet is reopened
via `onAskAi` without a button click.

### AiChatViewModel (ViewModel state — persists across sheet show/hide)

```
conversationId: StateFlow<String>  — active conversation ID (observable)
messages: StateFlow<List<ChatMessage>>  — messages in active conversation (observable)
private var _sourceUrl: String?    — URL associated with current conversation (NOT observable)
initialPromptSent: Boolean         — prevents re-sending prompt on recomposition
```

**`_sourceUrl` is NOT a StateFlow** — it's a private `var`. Changes are not observed by composables.
`setSourceUrl()` exists but only called from `AiChatScreen.LaunchedEffect(sourceUrl)`.
This means UI cannot reactively respond to sourceUrl changes.

## 3. Chat Entry Decision Trees

### 3A. AI Chat Button Click (direct user tap)

```
AI Chat Button Click
│
├─ url = engine.getUrl()
├─ normalizedUrl = normalizeUrlForMatch(url)
├─ matchedConv = findConversationByUrl(url)
├─ hasActiveChat = messages.isNotEmpty()
│
├─ hasActiveChat? ─── YES ──→ showAiChat = true
│                              (reopen current conversation, IGNORE current URL)
│                              ⚠️ This means URL mismatch is invisible to user
│
├─ matchedConv != null? ─── YES ──→ matchedConversationId = matchedConv.id
│                                     showAiChat = true
│                                     (resume URL-matched conversation)
│
├─ normalizedUrl != null? ─── YES ──→ showSessionChoice = true
│                                       (real URL, no match — ask user)
│
└─ else ──→ forceNewSession = true
             showAiChat = true
             (about:blank, chrome://, etc. — new session)
```

**Design note**: `hasActiveChat` takes priority over URL matching. This is intentional for quick resume,
but means navigating to a new URL while an old conversation is active will reopen the old conversation.
See Section 7 for known issues.

### 3B. onAskAi (browser-to-chat bridge, e.g. BridgeServer)

```
onAskAi(question)
│
├─ url = engineRef?.getUrl()
├─ currentConvId = chatViewModel.conversationId.value
├─ matched = findConversationByUrl(url)
│
├─ matched != null && matched.id != currentConvId? ── YES ──→ matchedConversationId = matched.id
│                                                            showSessionChoice = true
│                                                            pendingAiQuestion = question
│
└─ else ──→ forceNewSession = (matched == null)
             showAiChat = true
             pendingAiQuestion = question
```

**Key difference from button click**: onAskAi checks `matched.id != currentConvId` (avoids re-opening
same conversation), and does NOT check `hasActiveChat`. It also sets `pendingAiQuestion` which the
button click does not.

### 3C. Session Choice Dialog (triggered by 3A or 3B)

```
showSessionChoice == true
│
├─ matched != null? ─── YES ──→ AlertDialog with:
│   "Resume"  → showSessionChoice = false, showAiChat = true
│   "New"     → showSessionChoice = false, matchedConversationId = null,
│               forceNewSession = true, showAiChat = true
│
└─ matched == null ──→ forceNewSession = true, matchedConversationId = null,
                        showSessionChoice = false, showAiChat = true
                        (immediate — no LaunchedEffect delay)
```

## 4. URL Normalization Rules (`normalizeUrlForMatch`)

| Input | Output | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `about:blank` | `null` | Not a real page — no session matching |
| `chrome://*` | `null` | Internal browser page |
| `data:*` | `null` | Inline data |
| `https://example.com/path?query=1#frag` | `https://example.com/path` | Strip query & fragment |
| `https://example.com/` | `https://example.com/` | Root path preserved |
| `null` / unparsable | `null` | Safety fallback |

**Important**: `findConversationByUrl()` calls `normalizeUrlForMatch()` on both the input URL
and each saved `sourceUrl`. Two URLs match if their normalized forms are identical.

## 5. ViewModel Init: Auto-Restore

On creation, `AiChatViewModel.init` restores the most recent conversation:

```
conversations = listConversations()  // sorted by updatedAt descending
lastConv = conversations.firstOrNull()
if (lastConv != null) {
    conversationId = lastConv.id
    messages = load(lastConv.id)
    _sourceUrl = lastConv.sourceUrl   // Note: private var, not observable
}
```

**Implication**: After app restart, `messages` is non-empty → `hasActiveChat = true`.
This means the chat button will always reopen the last conversation,
regardless of current URL.

**about:blank conversation trap**: If a conversation was started on about:blank,
`sourceUrl` is null. After navigating to a real URL, `hasActiveChat` is still true,
so the button click reopens the about:blank conversation. URL matching is never reached.

## 6. SourceUrl Lifecycle

```
sourceUrl is set when:
  - newConversation(sourceUrl) called with current browser URL
  - loadConversation() restores sourceUrl from saved metadata
  - setSourceUrl(url) called from AiChatScreen LaunchedEffect(sourceUrl)

sourceUrl is NOT updated when:
  - User navigates to a new URL in the browser while chat is open
  - User types a message in an existing conversation

sourceUrl type: private var String? (NOT StateFlow)
  - Changes are NOT observed by composables
  - This means UI cannot reactively respond to sourceUrl changes
```

**Known issue**: If chat is open for URL A, user navigates to URL B in browser,
sourceUrl remains A while auto-capture provides context from B.
The saved conversation metadata (sourceUrl) will say A, but the content relates to B.
This affects URL-based session matching reliability.

## 7. Known Issues & Edge Cases

| # | Issue | Severity | Root Cause | Current Behavior | Desired Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Wrong conversation after URL change | Medium | `hasActiveChat` priority over URL matching | Reopens last conversation regardless of current URL | Consider: check URL match even with active chat, or show conversation title |
| 2 | ~~`forceNewSession` not reset on swipe dismiss~~ | ~~**High**~~ | ~~onDismissRequest didn't reset forceNewSession~~ | ~~Next open skips URL matching~~ | Both dismiss paths now reset forceNewSession | **FIXED (959d157)** |
| 3 | about:blank conversation blocks URL matching | Medium | `hasActiveChat=true` from auto-restore with sourceUrl=null | Button always reopens about:blank conversation | Consider: skip auto-restore when sourceUrl=null and current URL is real |
| 4 | sourceUrl becomes stale during navigation | Low | sourceUrl not updated on URL change | Saved metadata says URL A, content relates to URL B | Consider: update sourceUrl on URL change, or make it immutable |
| 5 | ~~Two different dismiss paths with different state cleanup~~ | ~~**High**~~ | ~~onDismissRequest vs onDismiss inconsistency~~ | ~~Swipe dismiss leaves dangling state~~ | Both paths now consistent | **FIXED (959d157)** |
| 6 | onAskAi and button click use different decision trees | Medium | Code duplication without shared logic | Different URL matching and state management | Consider: extract shared logic into ChatSessionResolver |
| 7 | `currentUrlForChat` not reset on dismiss | Low | Only re-set on button click, not on onAskAi | Stale URL if sheet reopened via onAskAi | Reset in both dismiss paths or move to ViewModel |
| 8 | HalfExpanded sheet state trap | Medium | `skipPartiallyExpanded=false` allows half-open state | User stuck in liminal sheet state, no re-expand affordance | Consider `skipPartiallyExpanded=true` or add expand gesture |
| 9 | Button click doesn't check `pendingAiQuestion` | Low | No mutual exclusion between button click and onAskAi | onAskAi-set prompt could be discarded by button tap | Guard: skip button logic if pendingAiQuestion is set |

## 8. State Transitions (Dismiss → Reopen)

When the bottom sheet is dismissed and reopened, these states persist (ViewModel):
- `conversationId`, `messages`, `_sourceUrl`, `initialPromptSent`

These states reset on dismiss (composition):
- `showAiChat`, `showSessionChoice`, `matchedConversationId`, `pendingAiQuestion`, `forceNewSession`

**Note**: `currentUrlForChat` does NOT reset on dismiss — it's re-set on every button click or onAskAi call. Stale values persist between dismiss/reopen cycles.

**Both dismiss paths now reset all composition state consistently** (fixed in 959d157).
`currentUrlForChat` is NOT reset by either path — it's re-set on every button click.

### State at Reopen

```
After any dismiss (swipe, back, or X button):
  showAiChat = false ✅
  forceNewSession = false ✅ (reset by both paths since 959d157)
  matchedConversationId = null ✅
  pendingAiQuestion = null ✅
  currentUrlForChat = (stale — re-set on next button click) ⚠️
  ViewModel state: unchanged
```
